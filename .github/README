XCORE
=====

X11 general utility that can be used in conjunction with shell scripts.

ABOUT
=====

Made this mainly for studying purposes. I wanted to apply linked list data
structure in a project to master it better. Secondly, this is a homework project
for when I create my own tiling window manager in X11.
